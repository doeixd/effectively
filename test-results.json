This error originated in "test/composition-utils.test.ts" test file. It doesn't mean the error was thrown inside the file itself, but while it was running.
The latest test that might've caused the error is "should fail after max attempts". It might mean one of the following:
- The error was thrown, while Vitest was running this test.
- If the error occurred after the test had been completed, this was the last documented test before it was thrown.

Serialized Error: { taskName: 'withRetry(anonymousTask, attempts=3)', taskIndex: +0 }
This error originated in "test/composition-utils.test.ts" test file. It doesn't mean the error was thrown inside the file itself, but while it was running.
The latest test that might've caused the error is "should use exponential backoff". It might mean one of the following:
- The error was thrown, while Vitest was running this test.
- If the error occurred after the test had been completed, this was the last documented test before it was thrown.
